# To do
1. design real system - class enrollment, generate invoice, scheduling
2. Google foo.bar
3. Interpret prefix, postfix, and infix mathematical expressions
4. Given a string and dictionary, return a string split into two words
5. class for 24 game, remove duplicate solutions
6. Read on Shannon information entropy. Construct Huffman tree from a probability distribution
7. generate nth fibonacci number with O(log n) time
8. Read about bloom filter
9. Read about Protocol Buffer
10. check out Spark and Hadoop APIs

## 4/17
1. C++ const reference, reference, copy inputs in function lead to overloading
2. 3 Google papers - Google FileSystem, MapReduce, BigTable
3. B-Tree, insert, delete, range query, scan
4. Data pipeline:
   1. storage
   2. processing
      1. MapReduce
         1. Map - for w in doc, emit(w, 1)
         2. shuffle
         3. reduce
      2. failure tolerance good
      3. Hadoop low level mapreduce, connect procedures through I/O
      4. apache spark - streaming process, skips I/O, connects steps for data processing, programmer offers DAG, compiler optimizes

5. bottleneck <-> hot spot -> load balancer
6. 3 hardware locations
   1. CPU - parallel, scale up
   2. memory - processing happens here
   3. disk - external system, slow, input has to come from disk 
      1. do middle stages need to write to disk - CPU trading disk I/O
      2. deal with failures, probabilistic trade off

concurrency - transactions
  - read, modify, write
  - automicity - check if read version has been modified

## Questions
1. Merkle tree
2. Protobuffer - serialize data cross platform
3. metaclass in python - reflection, self code writer
4. bloom filter


# Progress and Notes
Some progress updates

## 4/2
### Some Questions
1. In recursive functions, python allows function inside. Say if you need the recursive function to pass in additional parameters. How do we deal with this in C++? define a helper function.
2. LRU Cache #include issue - solved.
3. combinatorics questions such as https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1603439
4. parallel programming/computing
   - linking multiple computational units to speed up

5. distributed systems
   - storage across multiple factories
   - networking
   - backup systems to deal with failure
6. General considerations for OO design


Ads:
- big data solutions, pipelines, concurrency, serving, ranking (ML)

* include conflict example
  a.cpp
    #include a.h
    #include b.h
      #include a.h
  include guard called pre-compile macro: #ifndef

### OO Design
- error handling
  - error code
  - exception
- think about abstraction (interface)
  - which methods?
  - expandable, but don't over design
  - principle: one object achieves one task
- encapsulation: hide private functions and data, provides public information
  - contract between user and provider
  - user can never change private items
  - separate implementation from usage
- polymorphism
  - interface

### Memory leak
- memory leak: objects do not get deleted and overflows memory
  - delete in destructor
  - after owner , destructor is called
  - shared_ptr (ref counting) - if circular pointer, memory leak still happens
  - python has an automatic detector

- resource management
- software design patterns
