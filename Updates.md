# To do
1. Update deserialize code to operate while reading file
2. Interpret prefix, postfix, and infix mathematical expressions
3. Given a string and dictionary, return a string split into two words
4. class for 24 game, remove duplicate solutions
7. Read on Shannon information entropy. Construct Huffman tree from a probability distribution
8. generate nth fibonacci number with O(log n) time
