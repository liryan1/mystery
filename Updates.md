# To do
2. Interpret prefix, postfix, and infix mathematical expressions
3. Given a string and dictionary, return a string split into two words
4. class for 24 game, remove duplicate solutions
7. Read on Shannon information entropy. Construct Huffman tree from a probability distribution
8. generate nth fibonacci number with O(log n) time

# System Design Questions
* You have a server that can handle 10 requests per second. How would you handle a situation when 20 requests come?

# Questions
1. In recursive functions, python allows function inside. Say if you need the recursive function to pass in additional parameters. How do we deal with this in C++?
2. LRU Cache #include issue
3. distributed systems, parallel programming
4. General considerations for OO design
5.
