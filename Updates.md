# To do
1. Google foo.bar
2. design chess game
3. Interpret prefix, postfix, and infix mathematical expressions
4. Given a string and dictionary, return a string split into two words
5. class for 24 game, remove duplicate solutions
6. Read on Shannon information entropy. Construct Huffman tree from a probability distribution
7. generate nth fibonacci number with O(log n) time

## Questions
1. Merkle tree


# Progress and Notes
Some progress updates

## Questions 4/2
1. In recursive functions, python allows function inside. Say if you need the recursive function to pass in additional parameters. How do we deal with this in C++? define a helper function.
2. LRU Cache #include issue - solved.
3. combinatorics questions such as https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1603439
4. parallel programming/computing
   - linking multiple computational units to speed up

5. distributed systems
   - storage across multiple factories
   - networking
   - backup systems to deal with failure
6. General considerations for OO design


Ads:
- big data solutions, pipelines, concurrency, serving, ranking (ML)

* include conflict example
  a.cpp
    #include a.h
    #include b.h
      #include a.h
  include guard called pre-compile macro: #ifndef

### OO Design
- error handling
  - error code
  - exception
- think about abstraction (interface)
  - which methods?
  - expandable, but don't over design
  - principle: one object achieves one task
- encapsulation: hide private functions and data, provides public information
  - contract between user and provider
  - user can never change private items
  - separate implementation from usage
- polymorphism
  - interface

### Memory leak
- memory leak: objects do not get deleted and overflows memory
  - delete in destructor
  - after owner , destructor is called
  - shared_ptr (ref counting) - if circular pointer, memory leak still happens
  - python has an automatic detector

- resource management
- software design patterns

  - polymorphism
  - interface
  - dynamic dispatch & RTTI in C++
